Drunk Elephant,Protini™ Polypeptide Moisturizer,face moisturizer,68.0,4.0,"What it is:  A protein moisturizer that combines signal peptides, growth factors, amino acids, and pygmy waterlily to improve the look of skin’s tone, texture, and firmness.Skin Type: Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily Skincare Concerns: Dryness, Dullness and Uneven Texture, and Loss of Firmness and ElasticityHighlighted Ingredients:- Nine Signal Peptide Complex: Serves to bind moisture to skin to plump, firm, and restore bounce to skin’s appearance, helping to support skin’s natural self-renewal process. - Pygmy Waterlily Stem Cell Extract: Acts as an excellent source of antioxidants and nutrients to nurture the skin; it is extremely moisturizing, soothing, and calming and is effective in supporting healthy, youthful-looking skin. - Soybean Folic Acid Ferment Extract: A B vitamin that plays a central role in maintaining youthful, elastic skin; skin becomes actively thirsty for folic acid, especially after exposure to sun.  Ingredient Callouts: This product is vegan and cruelty-free. What Else You Need to Know: Protini restores younger, revived-looking skin. Lines, wrinkles, and sun damage appear reduced and skin feels strengthened and moisturized. Think of Protini like adding protein to your smoothie. Abundant with proteins and nutrients, it replenishes and restores skin to a strong, healthy state. Formulated at an ideal pH level of 4.0. Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This skin-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clinical Results:  In an independent consumer-testing panel of 50 women ages 25 to 55:- 100% agreed their skin felt replenished and nurtured - 97% agreed their skin felt moisturized- 97% agreed their skin texture felt soft and smooth Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Drunk Elephant,Lala Retro™ Whipped Moisturizer with Ceramides,face moisturizer,60.0,4.0,"What it is: A rescue cream infused with six rare African oils and a ceramide complex for intense moisture and replenishing barrier support. Skin Type: Normal, Dry, Combination, and OilySkincare Concerns: Dryness, Fine Lines, and WrinklesFormulation: Rich CreamHighlighted Ingredients:- Six Rare African Oil Blend: Nourshes, rejuvenates, and moisturizes.- Ceramides AP, EOP, and NP: Help soothe and maintain the moisture balance of skin while protecting against water loss.- Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer: Has a smaller molecular weight than hyaluronic acid and is able to deeply penetrate skin, delivering excellent hydration and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. What Else You Need to Know: Additional ingredients sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer and antioxidant-rich fermented green tea release hydration, defend against everyday stressors, and combat signs of aging. With a pH level of 5.2, Lala Retro™ has the luxurious texture of a rich face cream without feeling suffocating or heavy. Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, “clean” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make “Clean Compatible” skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products, they focus on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

What else you need to know:Beste™ No. 9 is formulated at an ideal, non-stripping pH level of 5.5. 100 percent free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. 
Note: In Afrikaans, Beste means Best. Even though the first eight versions weren’t exactly that, Drunk Elephant thinks they’ve finally found the best one yet. They are calling it Beste™ No. 9 after going through nine formulations to get there! Only the Beste will do.
Note from Tiffany Masterson, Drunk Elephant Founder: ""We took your feedback about the original Beste and made some changeswe swapped out the twist top packaging for a trusty flip top and tweaked the formula so it’s gentle enough to use on eyes (and remove every last trace of makeup).""
Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin.

They make “Clean Compatible”skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products, they focus on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Pekee is fragrance- and soap-free and at an ideal pH level of 6.5 to cleanse and calm without drying or stripping skin it of its protective barrier. Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""clean"" is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""Clean Compatible"" skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""a clean break""), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

What Else You Need to Know: Infused with thermal mud, marula, bamboo, and superfruit, Juju dissolves pore-clogging excess oil, surface debris, and impurities while gently exfoliating for softer, smoother skin with improved clarity. Juju is fragrance and soap-free and at a pH level of 6.3 to cleanse without drying or stripping.Drunk Elephant difference:Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, ""“clean""” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make ""“Clean Compatible""” skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""“Suspicious 6""” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see, and when entirely removed from one’s routine, (""“a clean break""”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what they leave out of the products as what they put in. This ingredient-elimination diet (think Whole30 for your face) inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating their products, Drunk Elephant focuses on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Pekee Bar™ is a gentle multitasker with a 6.5 pH-level that clarifies, balances, and moisturizes, and removes surface debris, impurities, and excess oil. Juju Bar is an ultra-mild multitasker with a 6.3 pH-level that deeply cleanses and subtly exfoliates.Drunk Elephant Difference: Drunk Elephant is clean, but in their opinion, “clean” is not enough when it comes to caring for skin. They make “Clean Compatible”skincare. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the “Suspicious 6” in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, and SLS) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see and when entirely removed from one’s routine (“a clean break”), skin can reset and return to a healthy, balanced state. It is equally, if not more, important what we leave out of the products as what we put in. This ingredient-elimination diet inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies chronicling the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found success using the line and renewed confidence in their own skin. When formulating the products, they focus on biocompatibility, pH levels, and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels and remain respectful and always supportive of skin’s acid mantle.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.This Set Contains:- 30 g/ 1 oz Travel-size Pekee Bar™- 30 g/ 1 oz Travel-size Juju BarClinical Results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 101 women ages 25 to 55 using Pekee Bar™:- 96% agreed skin was thoroughly cleansed- 92% agreed skin was clean of all makeup - 85% agreed skin felt soft and smooth - 84% found skin was firmer and more balanced- 81% found Pekee Bar™ was calming and soothing - 81% agreed skin appeared more youthfulIn an independent consumer testing panel of 101 women ages 25 to 55 using JuJu Bar:- 95% found skin felt completely cleansed of impurities and excess oil- 95% agreed skin felt balanced- 94% found it effectively exfoliated skin- 93% agreed skin looked clarified and felt healthier- 92% found skin felt softer and smoother- 92% agreed it was perfect for their skin type  Clean at SephoraClean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

✔ Coiled
✔ Tightly Coiled
What it is:
 A dual-action conditioner that visually enhances hair volume and promotes long-term growth. 
Key benefits:
- Creates fuller-looking hair
- Encourages long-term follicle growth
- Promotes softness with no sticky residue
If you want to know more…
 Blossom & Bloom™ Ginseng + Biotin Volumizing Conditioner utilizes natural volumizing agents to promote fuller, thicker-looking hair from the inside out. Natural sugar derivative maltodextrin coats and increases the diameter of each strand, creating the appearance of more voluminous hair. Ginseng and biotin help stimulate blood flow to the scalp, promoting long-term growth of new follicles. Contrary to most volumizing products, this non-alcohol formula harnesses the power of 95 percent naturally derived ingredients to visibly thicken hairsans the drying, sticky, or stiff after-effects that can dull and damage tresses over time.  




What else you need to know:
 This product is free of silicones, artificial fragrances, and artificial dyes. It is vegan-friendly and cruelty-free.

The Briogeo brand was inspired by a family tradition of making natural beauty products at home in the kitchen of founder Nancy Twine. Nancy believes the answer to beautiful, healthy, and charismatic hair exists within nature's own ingredients.

✔ Wavy
✔ Curly
✔ Coiled
✔ Tightly Coiled
What it is:
 A non-lathering, conditioning cleanser that removes impurities without stripping hair of color or natural oils.
Key benefits:
- Hydrates dry, course hair
- Detangles and increases manageability
- Lifts away impurities without stripping 
If you want to know more…
 Unlike many traditional shampoos, the non-lathering Be Gentle, Be Kind™ Avocado + Quinoa Co—Wash is so hydrating, you typically won’t need to follow up with a conditioner. The formula’s high-slip nature makes for easy detangling and manageability, creating hair that feels soft, hydrated, and tangle-free. It is recommended for those with textured, thick, coarse, curly, or dry hair, and even helps to extend color—nourishing chemically-treated, relaxed, or keratin-treated hair. Hair that’s thick is typically on the dryer side of the spectrum, which tends to mean hair oils don’t spread as intensely through the hair shaft as with thinner or finer hair. Contrary to sudsing shampoos—which can cause higher levels of oil loss—this super-creamy cleanser leaves hair looking luxuriously quenched. 




What else you need to know:
